# Surewin-Blackjack
An all in one blackjack training mobile application. Developed for Android

Background
Blackjack has been one of the most popular casino banking game played.
It traditionally uses decks of 52 cards. It is easy to play and the rules are
simple.

However, mathematically speaking, traditional blackjack favors the
dealer, even when the player uses perfect strategy, he or she loses on
average about 1% of their action in the long run. This is one of the lowest
edges the casino has over a player, and it is also one of the very few that
the player can get an edge over the house coupled with other strategies.

This project intends to provide a more rewarding gaming experience to
gamers, giving them a higher sense of achievement and satisfaction. This
will be done by a development of a mobile game application which
allows users to play the game of blackjack with variants and aids.

Some of the commonly used variants include, dealer hitting on soft-17,
multiple deck shoe, etc. Aids will also be provided such as a card counter. Additional handicap to the dealer could also be implemented such that the probability of the player winning will be manipulated to as high as 100%.

Objectives
To provide a more rewarding gaming experience to general gamers
To provide a comprehensive platform to train people to make better decisions in the game of blackjack
